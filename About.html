								<p>About me<br />
								Hello and thank you for checking out my ePortfolio! My name is Simon, currently enrolled in an MSc in Cybersecurity at University of Essex Online. I didn't start my career in IT though. I first graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BA in Economics. I eventually transitioned from working as an economist to an IT role and haven't looked back! When I'm not working, or studying I enjoy travelling and landscape/wildlife photography.</p>

										<h2>Brief Intro</h2>
									</header>
									<p>As stated above, I didn't get my start in IT. I originally studied and worked as an economist in the veterinary space. I then went back to school for an IT Professional program that gave me a good foundation in IT administration. Through this process I also obtained certificatoin in Linux administration via LPIC and CompTia Linux +, Network +, and Project +. I've since worked in everything from very small IT consulting shops to where I'm at now, which is a 12,ooo+ person organization.
Outside of work I'm passionate about the outdoors, wildlife and land/wildlife conservancy. I enjoy backcountry camping and hiking as well as wildlife and landscape photography</p>

												<h3>Work History</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In terms of relevant work experience, my first technology related role was working for Microsoft UK (Reading office) where I helped the marketing analytics team process queries for various projects. This was a two summer internship while I was completing my economics degree. I reskilled out of economics between 2013-2015 and got my first IT role at CopperTree Solutions as a support tech and eventually as a network administrator doing infrastructure compliance evaluations. I then moved on to a similar, but larger managed service provider called HLB System Solutions where I worked as a junior project technician, professional services tech and network administrator.</p> 
                                                                                        <p> I finally moved to Aeryon Labs in 2017. This was my first exposure to a small/medium company with around 250 employees. This was also my entrance to IT within the defense space, as Aeryon Labs builds drones for commercial and military applications. Aeryon would go on to be aquired by FLIR Systems in 2019; firmly solidifying my space in the defense industry and giving me an appreciation for the importance of sound cyber security practice. </p>
										        <p> At the start of 2021, FLIR was purchased by Teledyne Technologies, a large, global umbrella corporation made up of many companies spread across the aerospace, defense and science industries. In fact, you can see Teledyne's logo on the old Mars rover as they designed much of the sensors and optics on it. I look forward to hopefully embedding myself in their cybersecurity team while I progress through my program, further adding to my education through real world application.</p>

												<h3>Benchmark Statement</h3>
											</header>
											<p>What my five years in the industry has taught me is a strong understanding of the user and the systems they use (and I ultimately support). I have a working knowledge of server systems, networking and end user platfomrs, the latter being by strongest area. What I hope to learn is a greater understanding of security and how best to identify vulnerabilities and ultimately safeguard against external and internal threats.</p>
